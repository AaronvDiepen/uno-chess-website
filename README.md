## Uno-Chess
Uno-Chess is a modification of normal chess in which capture rules have been reversed. A piece can only be captured by any piece in its normal attacking positions. So keep in mind that pawns are more valuable than queens and kings can only be checked from their 8 surrounding squares.

This is an adaptation of the server written by Zack Noyes, this version depends more on the chess package from rust for its game decisions instead of adding an extra layer.
